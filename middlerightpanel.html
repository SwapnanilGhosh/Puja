<h1><b>Welcome to our website</b></h1>
<img src="line_ver.png">
<br><br>
<p>Sometimes when we have an opportunity to walk down the memory lane, strange feeling creeps in our mind that how and by whose stroke of magic word the embryonic organization once formed by few juvenile minds has taken this mammoth shape, size and distinct in 95 years of its onward journey.</p>
<br>
<p>It has always been an onerous task for all family members to build the stage for the glittering glory. Lots of people turing heavily during the puja days, appreciate our creation, even share concerns of us but it is difficult to depict the tireless efforts and amount of workload shouldered by our organizers for previous 2-3 months to make this Durgotsab a grand success. But all our weariness after few month's struggle soothes immediately when we look at the shining faces of our visitors who leave the place with satisfaction.</p>
<br>
<p>We extend our sincere thanks to all our organizers, members and their families without whose support and cooperation such a mega event could not have been organized. We owe a lot to our benevolent subscribers and patrons who have pillared our success.</p>
